title: First brainstorm

## Factors

- Map service not effective
  - given a list of things that i want to see, I should be able to easily get the best way to see everything
- I don't get to see a picture of my location when I am trying to plan routes.
- Modules should be location-centric - time (in and between attractions) and distance are the primary considerations
- Leisure (more time allocated to vibe/shop) vs Focused (on ticking things off the list)
- Social?

## Other Ideas

- Travel Planner
- Accessible Private Banking
  - Having someone // something to manage money on your behalf to ensure that it is working for you.
  - Pooling together many small capital to gain access to something larger (Fractionalized ownership)
    - REITS
    - Staking to become a validator
- Casino Gaming
- Allowing anyone to raise capital for projects (essentially an IPO. Securities is a huge legal issue)
- Sport score tracking

- Receipts for big brand items (e.g. Rolex, exp sneakers etc.)
- Online Therapy
